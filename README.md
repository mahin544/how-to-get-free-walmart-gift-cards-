1. Sign Up for Rewards Websites

Rewards websites are one of the easiest ways to earn free Walmart gift cards. These platforms reward users for completing simple tasks such as surveys, watching videos, shopping online, or playing games. Below are some of the best options:

Swagbucks: This popular rewards platform offers multiple ways to earn points, called "SB." Once you've accumulated enough SB, you can redeem them for Walmart gift cards.

Tasks include watching videos, taking surveys, shopping online, and using their search engine.

New users often receive bonus points for signing up.

InboxDollars: Similar to Swagbucks, InboxDollars pays you to complete surveys, play games, and read emails. You can cash out your earnings in the form of Walmart gift cards.

MyPoints: Earn points by shopping through their portal, completing surveys, or engaging in activities like watching videos. Points can be redeemed for a variety of gift cards, including Walmart.

2. Participate in Cashback Apps

Cashback apps reward you for shopping at your favorite stores, including Walmart. By using these apps, you can earn points or cash that can be redeemed for Walmart gift cards:

Ibotta: This app gives you cashback on specific items you purchase at Walmart. Simply upload your receipt or link your Walmart account to earn rewards.

Rakuten: Earn cashback for shopping online at Walmart through the Rakuten portal. Once your cashback balance reaches a certain threshold, you can request a gift card.

Fetch Rewards: Scan your receipts from any store, including Walmart, to earn points. These points can then be converted into Walmart gift cards.

3. Enter Online Sweepstakes

Many companies and websites run sweepstakes where Walmart gift cards are a common prize. While the chances of winning may vary, entering is usually free and straightforward:

Follow Walmart’s social media accounts for announcements about contests and giveaways.

Search for reputable sweepstakes platforms that list current giveaways involving Walmart gift cards.

4. Take Advantage of Credit Card Rewards

If you use a rewards credit card, you may already be earning points for your purchases. Many credit card companies allow you to redeem points for Walmart gift cards. Here’s how to maximize this option:

Use your credit card for everyday purchases and pay off the balance monthly to avoid interest.

Check if your credit card has special promotions offering bonus points for Walmart or grocery store purchases.

5. Join Walmart’s Programs

Walmart itself offers programs that can help you save money or earn rewards:

Walmart Rewards Program: Use the Walmart app to earn rewards on select items. These rewards can be applied to future purchases, essentially functioning like a gift card.

Walmart Credit Card: With the Walmart credit card, you earn cashback on your purchases, which can be redeemed for Walmart gift cards.

6. Participate in Referral Programs

Many apps and websites offer referral programs. By referring friends and family to sign up for these platforms, you can earn additional points or cash, which can then be redeemed for Walmart gift cards:

Encourage your network to join platforms like Swagbucks, Ibotta, or Rakuten using your referral link.

Some platforms provide bonus rewards when your referrals start earning points.

7. Watch Out for Promotional Offers

Occasionally, Walmart or its partners offer promotional deals that include free gift cards:

Check Walmart’s website and app for "buy one, get a gift card" deals on select products.

Keep an eye on seasonal promotions, such as Black Friday or back-to-school events, where gift cards may be offered as part of a purchase incentive.

8. Sell Unwanted Items

If you have items you no longer need, consider selling them and converting the proceeds into a Walmart gift card:

Use platforms like eBay, Facebook Marketplace, or local selling apps.

Some websites, such as CardCash, allow you to trade other gift cards for Walmart gift cards.

9. Use Survey Apps

Survey apps are another excellent way to earn gift cards. Many of these platforms pay you in points for sharing your opinions:

Survey Junkie: Complete surveys to earn points that can be redeemed for Walmart gift cards.

Pinecone Research: Offers high-paying surveys with the option to cash out in Walmart gift cards.

Google Opinion Rewards: Although less frequent, surveys on this app are quick and easy, and the rewards can be redeemed for gift cards.

10. Engage in Microtask Platforms

Microtask platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk or TaskRabbit pay you to complete small tasks. You can then use your earnings to purchase Walmart gift cards:

Tasks might include data entry, transcription, or small errands.

Cash out your earnings and convert them into Walmart gift cards through platforms like PayPal or prepaid card services.

11. Follow Influencers and Blogs

Many influencers and blogs frequently host giveaways, including Walmart gift cards. To increase your chances:

Follow influencers in the lifestyle and shopping niches.

Subscribe to newsletters and watch for announcements about gift card giveaways.

12. Leverage Social Media

Social media platforms often feature giveaways hosted by brands or influencers. To participate:

Search for hashtags like #WalmartGiftCard or #GiftCardGiveaway.

Follow and engage with Walmart’s official social media pages for promotions and contests.

Tips to Avoid Scams

While many legitimate methods exist, it's essential to stay vigilant against scams:

Avoid websites that ask for sensitive information, such as your credit card or Social Security number, in exchange for gift cards.

Be wary of "too good to be true" offers promising large gift card amounts for minimal effort.

Stick to reputable platforms with verified reviews and transparent policies.
